### Hi there üëã, I'm Diego Mora.

I started this journey of being part of the people who is building technology in 2012 (I was 16 at that time) when I decided to become an Electronic Engineer. Now, I'm pivoting to be an amazing Backend Developer (Still in progress). I'm part of cohort 8 at [Platzi Master](https://platzi.com/master/)

## I'm a Developer and a couple of other things...

I'm a person passionate by technology with knowledge in hardware and software. Currently, I am more involved in Backend Development using Java Spring, however as a lifelong learner my personal goal is to change to JS or Python stack. 

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on finthech, still looking for my real passion. 
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning a lot from everything tech related, but my focus at this time is to master web backend development. 
- üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on projects which have a real positive impact on people. 
- ü•Ö 2021 - 2022 Goals: Understand current backend technologies and start learning web3; learn to dance salsa; became a better photographer. 
- ‚ö° Fun fact: I have three lovely dogs üê∂üê∂üê∂ which I love with all my might. Also, I studied some photography and fell in love of portraits.
